              continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
              challenges and <br /> learning the latest technologies along the
              way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 <br /> years after starting my
              web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge <br /> web
              applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
              TypeScript, <br /> Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
